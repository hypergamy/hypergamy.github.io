## Introduction

We all know that having a great in person presence and cold-calling is key to running proper game. I am a huge 
proponent of getting out there and talking to women in as many different settings as you can put yourself in.  

But what about that online presence you've created for yourself? Have you really tried pushing things? For many men,
their online presence, and their willingness to invest any amount of time into it is directly proportionate 
to the amount of women in their area or city. Once you break that down into women that you find "acceptable", 
the SMP can seem to evaporate before your eyes. Fortunately I live in an area that has a large population, with 
acceptable candidates. The beauty of any online experiments you may choose to run is that with Match 
you can change your postal code and search radius to anywhere in the U.S., Canada, or the U.K.  


I don't want to sound like Captain Obviousâ„¢ here, but think for a moment about how empowering that is for you, 
the enlightened male.  

Even half a decade ago, "online dating" was considered taboo, a realm strictly for the biggest of losers. 
Today it's so pervasive in Western Society you can't go very far without running into someone who has tried it, 
or even found a **SO** via online dating. In the past, to run game on women in a different state or city, you had to 
actually GO TO that city or state to interact with women from that area. Now through the power of tools like Match, 
you can run experiments all day from the comfort of your home. Want to see how women in New York react to your lines? 
Go ahead. _Do you actually want to see what the women online in New York look like?_ You _can_ do that.  


## Background on the experiment

[Rollo](http://therationalmale.com/) recently wrote a piece titled 
[Open Hypergamy](http://therationalmale.com/2014/08/07/open-hypergamy/) 
which was an excellent review of where things are at on the female side of the hypergamy spectrum.
(See the quote in section "Getting the Best of Her")

Also, on [RPF](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill), Whisper recently posted an essay titled 
[The Redefinition of Marriage](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2d9k75/the_redefinition_of_marriage/)
Now I'm not going to critique either post here, but it got me thinking about what a relationship can have, and what 
many can be missing. From my own personal experience, many women are so over specialized in one area of life, they might as 
well be handicapped in the others. "Oh, baking... I'm terrible at that!" Or, "rock climbing, never tried it before, I'm really 
uncoordinated." Many women today, at least in the U.S., are so overwhelmingly focused in one area of life, it's as if the others do not exist.
Yet in today's world of free (or cheap) exchange of knowledge via web sites like Youtube, Meetup.com, Coursea, Quora, etc. it's easier now 
than ever to be that women who can do it all.

So I decided to create a Match profile, with a twist at the end.

Now before you get ahead of yourself, my first experiment actually deals with women that are in the area I currently live in.

I've actually been running a series of small experiments on Match for about two years now. 
Below is the profile that I uploaded yesterday afternoon. For the sake of experimental control, 
I changed my profile name and replaced some of the existing photos with different photos of myself for this experiment.

## Current Profile

>Born with eidetic memory, I've spent the last decade collecting knowledge on a variety of topics and subjects.
>I'm into things like backcountry skiing, motorcycle rides, backpacking trips, jumping off cliffs and waterfalls, bicycle rides, sunsets, mountains, beer, wine, whiskey, 
>reading, etc, etc. The key thing for me is ensuring variety and some spontaneity.

>I've recently switched roles within my company, and work from home many days, as many of my co-workers are in different states and countries.

>I have had several different jobs over the years, in a variety of professions, but I have overwhelmingly spent the most time in the computer and software industry. As I have spent so much time 
>collecting a knowledge base, I do have a strong entrepreneurial spirit and ideas are constantly flowing through me.

>Most recently I embarked on a new expedition, one that involves traveling and experiencing first hand many of the things and places I've read about and studied over the years.

>My main goals for 2014 are to focus on entrepreneurial pursuits, as well as traveling, and exploring new hobbies.

>In 2014, I have traveled to Costa Rica, Chicago, and New England. As well as a number of skiing, hiking and bicycling days/trips... I also have two motorcycles which are a lot fun!

>My next trip in 2014 is to Europe, starting out in Barcelona, heading to Rome.

>About what I'm looking for:
>After having several relationships that have always left me wanting more than a single partner could provide, I'm now focusing on developing two relationships with what I'm really looking for.

>A partner who has an adventurous and athletic personality who wants to get out and do many of the outdoor activities that I enjoy so much.

>Another partner who has domestic skills, organizational ability, and attention to detail. It's nice to have home cooked meals AND go out to a nice restaurant sometimes as well.

>My experience thus far has shown me that within the U.S. these traits are rarely found in the same woman, which has led me to creating a larger relationship. 
>Ideally both of you will be interested in travel and seeing much of what the world has to offer.

>Great communication and conversational abilities are really appreciated, no matter what your other strong areas are. A strong chemistry between the three of us is a must have as well.

## First Results 

The first results of this experiment are already starting to come in:

> ### Subject: 100% match?

>100% match? Maybe I can be both of the women you're looking for....
>Meghan


>Hi Meghan,
>Thanks for reaching out. I just saw your message. I like your style with that 100% match statement. 
>Nice job. I just checked out your profile and photos. It's clear to me that we need to meet up! 
>I saw your headline, are you from New York state? Where did you grow up?  

>cheers,  
>Ronin  
>XXX-XXX-XXXX  

>Actually from Boston but couldn't resist the Anchorman quote, gotcha! I am hoping you were kidding with that two woman stuff..
>Meghan


>Ah you got me! Anchorman/2 has some good lines in it for sure! I think The Big Lebowski has some really good lines in it, such a classic.
>Actually, I was just in Boston in June. Passing through on my way to New Hampshire. How long have you been out here?
>I'm fine with one woman if she can fill in both of those roles I described. What sorts of stuff have you been into lately?  
>Ronin


Now it's clear that she wanted to flirt a bit, and I'm being way to direct with her right from the start. I'm also not following the 2/3 rule here, 
with such verbose responses to such short messages, but that's not the point of this experiment. The point is that no matter how wild or crazy 
your ideas may be, there is probably a woman out there who will find it interesting.

What are you experimenting with lately?

cheers,
