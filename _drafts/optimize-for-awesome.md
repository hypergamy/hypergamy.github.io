title: Optimize for Awesome
author: ronin
summary: Whatever it is you are trying to build, optimize your environment.

My research has shown that this probably means that you will not have a significant female in your life at that point in time.
Take a look at most succesful men over time, especially the last 10-20 years and you will see a pattern.
The pattern, is that men who have built something all state, is one way, or another, that they might not have been able
to build/accopmlish what they achived if there was a girlfriend/wife/child/whatever taking up precious hours of their day
that they could otherwise spend on their own project.  

This brings us to the crux of the matter:  
> Whatever big thing you are trying do in your life right now, optimize for awesome.  

That will most likely mean that for the next XX months while you are laser focused on whatever it is you are trying to build 
you will not have much of a female presence in your life. I'm guessing here that whatever it is you are trying to build or 
accomplish will only take months, rather than years to get to a point that you can then apply your attention to other things.  

I make this assumption for these reasons:
* Most of the things worth doing these days in any field of work can probably be assembled to a point of cohesion in 
a time frame of months, not years.

* If you do not apply the laser focus that you know you actually can to your project, instead choosing to spread your attention 
across many different things, including for example, women, girlfriend, wife, etc. your project timeline __will most likely move 
from a scale of months to__ **__years__**.
